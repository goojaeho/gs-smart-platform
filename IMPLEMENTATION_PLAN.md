### Priority Implementation Order

**High Priority (Must Have):**
1. Color scheme update
2. Student horizontal menu layout
3. Learning Mate basic interface
4. Enhanced Online Library
5. Teacher dashboard layout update

**Medium Priority (Should Have):**
1. Problem Solving module
2. Drawing canvas for Q&A
3. AI diagnosis interface
4. Parent summary dashboard
5. Mentoring enhancements

**Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
1. Advanced character animations
2. Complex analytics visualizations
3. Advanced emotional AI features
4. Detailed progress animations

---

### Technical Considerations

#### Challenges:
1. **Layout Migration:** Converting from vertical sidebar to horizontal menu requires significant layout restructuring
2. **Canvas Implementation:** Drawing functionality for math explanations needs HTML5 Canvas or SVG implementation
3. **Character System:** Learning Mate character progression requires animation and state management
4. **Real-time Features:** Mentoring and Q&A systems may need WebSocket implementation

#### Solutions:
1. **Responsive Design:** Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for flexible horizontal menu layouts
2. **Canvas Library:** Consider using libraries like Konva.js or Fabric.js for drawing functionality
3. **Animation:** Use Framer Motion or CSS animations for character progression
4. **State Management:** Leverage Zustand for complex state management across features
